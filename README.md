# nodejs-sample-apps
Simple applications to demonstrate Node.js functionality.

These examples are grouped by lectures, and contain about 3/4 examples each.
To run an application, first clone the repo to your hard drive via `git clone https://github.com/j7caiman/nodejs-sample-apps.git`
Then, navigate to the example you wish to run. For example, let's start with the "read file" example, located at "file_io_examples/readFile"
Then, run `npm install` to install any dependencies you might need. This step is optional for the first few examples, which have no dependencies.
From that directory, run `node src/example.js`. You're all done!
